# Pyber_Analysis
Analysis of ride-sharing data by city using pandas and matplotlib

## Project Overview
In this challenge, we will be creating a summary DataFrame of the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type. We will be using Pandas functions such as pivot and resample with Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type. Finally, a report on the results of the new analysis, will be written.

## Result of the Analysis

The ride-sharing summary by city type shows: the Total Rides, Total Drivers, the Total Fares, the Average Fare per Ride, and the Average Fare per Driver.

On the picture below, we see that the "Rural" have the highest average fare per Ride and Driver, followed by the "Suburban" and the "Urban" with the lowest numbers between January and April 2019.

The result of our analysis shows that the" Urban" have the highest total fares, followed by the "Suburban" and then the "rural" with the lowest numbers from January through April. (Check picture below).

## Summary

Here are 3 business recommendations based on the results to address disparities found amongst the cities.

1) Reducing the fare could increase the numbers of riders 
2) Offer incentive in order to get mores drivers in 
3) Offer option to pick up multiple riders going to the same direction during busy hours to maximize total fares.
